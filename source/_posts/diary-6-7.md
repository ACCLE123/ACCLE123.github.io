### Algorithms

Reflection, Summarization, Challenges

### Exams: Results and Process

Worries about poor exam performance:

In high school, the mindset was that poor performance was a reminder to work harder.

In university, the mindset was that poor performance wasn't too bad compared to some others, so there was no need to feel guilty.

Actually, both of these mindsets are flawed. They focus on the results and not on the process.

Focusing on the process can improve the results, while focusing on the results only causes anxiety.
