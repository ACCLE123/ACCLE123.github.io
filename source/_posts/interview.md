I passed two interviews before, but I didn't pass the managerial interview.

The interview, which had no any technical issues, consisted only of 10 minutes of small talk, and I was rejected based solely on that.

The manager didn't even give me a reason.

I don't know what mistake I made, if any.

### Move on

Don't cry over spilled milk.

I need to encourage myself, and keep studying the cs knowledge.

I shouldn't dwell on the failure, so that would make me sad and slow me down.

Move on, you have a bright future.

### Maybe wrong

The manager asked me, 'can I hold up in the high-pressure situation'. I said, 'maybe I can, I can challenge this'.

But this answer was very harmful, I should have said 'Yes, I can, because others can do, I can too'.
