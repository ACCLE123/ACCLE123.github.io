I passed two interviews before, but I didn't pass the managerial interview.

The interview, which had no any technical issues, consist only of 10 minutes of small talk, and I was rejected based solely on that.

The manager didn't even give me a reason.

I don't know what mistake I made.

### Move on

Don't cry over spilled milk.

I need to encourage myself, and keep studying the cs knowledge.

Don't dwell on the failure, so that would make me sad and slow me down.

Move on, you a have bright future.

### Maybe wrong

confidence

The manager asked me, 'can I hold up in the high-pressure situation'. I said, 'maybe I can, I can challenge this'.

But this answer is very harmful, I need to say, 'Yes, I can, because others can do, I can do too'.
