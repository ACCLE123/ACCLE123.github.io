### syntax test

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b;
    
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << a + b << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

$$
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} 
$$

$E=mc^2$

### update my blog system

Write is good for thinking deeply, which is why I need to write a blog. 
I used to blog in a simple and plain format, but now I have updated it.
The decent format makes daily work more comfortable.

Don't write about blog details too meticulously, as it will waste your time. Just recording some interesting things will be better.
